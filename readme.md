## Introduction

This repository provides an overview of various design patterns that can be applied to solve coding problems effectively. Understanding these patterns can help streamline your thought process during interviews and enhance your coding skills. Special thanks to Refactoring Guru for their comprehensive resources on design patterns.

## Design Patterns

### Creational Patterns

- Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
- Builder: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.

### Structural Patterns

- Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by acting as a bridge.
- Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

### Behavioral Patterns

- Observer: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified.
- State: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.
- Strategy: Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime by encapsulating the algorithms in separate classes.
